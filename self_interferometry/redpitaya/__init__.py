"""Red Pitaya hardware interface module.

``RedPitayaManager`` is intentionally not re-exported here. ``manager`` imports
from ``self_interferometry.synthetic``, whose ``waveform`` module imports
``RedPitayaConfig`` from this package; eagerly importing ``manager`` in this
``__init__`` would close that cycle during package initialization. Import the
manager directly from its module instead::
